Med-don Medicine Donation website

I designed and developed a locally hosted Website where the community can provide Excess pharmaceuticals to theunderprivileged i.e. 270 million people in India.
60% of Needy people who can't afford medication can filter available medicines based on attributes like City,Medicine Name, Ingredients, functions, and Contact and get it delivered for themselves or their folks.
Medications of up to 500 crores are wasted each year in India, and this is our attempt to hand out them to theunderprivileged also cuts short a lot of medicinal wastage.
